00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,240
hi my name is james and this is a

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,560
cardano starter kit

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
thanks for checking it out the name of

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,638
this starter kit is how to talk about

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,558
cardano with your friends and family

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,079
and if you're thinking wow that's a

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,239
pretty presumptuous title

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,278
you're exactly right i want to get

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,159
something clear

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,160
i'm not an expert on this i'm on this

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,679
journey too and i want to figure out how

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
to get better at this

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,559
and if i do this starter kit right

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
you're going to have your own ideas at

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,919
the end of it for how you want to talk

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
about cardano

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
for how you want to address different

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
problems than the ones

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
i want to address okay we're on a

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
journey together

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,238
i really just want to kind of help get

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,439
conversations going

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,878
and then get out of the way now i happen

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,320
to be a teacher

25
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:53,439
we all have our own domains of expertise

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,039
mine is education and so what i want to

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,399
do to start this

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
starter kit is is share a few education

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,759
terms with you if you're not a teacher

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,878
maybe you don't think about things in

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,118
these terms

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,798
but i'm hoping that by throwing these

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,118
ideas out there

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
these might prompt some line of thinking

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,478
in your mind

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
and then you can pursue that so i'm

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
going to share these terms

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,599
don't worry too much about remembering

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
what the words are

40
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,239
i just want to get some ideas out there

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
so that we can then use them

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,000
as we move through this starter kit if

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,798
you find any of these

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
ideas particularly useful i'm providing

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
some links

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
for following up but you can also join

47
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,359
our conversation in the gimbal labs

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
discord

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,959
if you want to continue these

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,000
conversations ask new questions

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,879
ask for further resources and so on

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,478
so let's get going project-based

53
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,039
learning is something that we're really

54
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,280
big on at gimbal labs and at workshop

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
maybe and it's just based on this idea

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,599
that people learn

57
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,679
best by doing things

58
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,798
similar to project-based learning is

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
problem-based

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
learning we learn best when we have a

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,399
chance to figure things out

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,118
for ourselves pbl

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
is an acronym that's a really convenient

64
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,560
catch-all

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
for both of these terms because they're

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,159
connected

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
when we work on projects whether it's a

68
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,039
home improvement

69
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:23,280
project or a business project

70
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,318
anything we might want to accomplish out

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
in the world

72
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,799
we run into problems this is what

73
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
software development is all about right

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
we run into problems that we then have

75
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,799
to figure out new things

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,159
and that's how we develop expertise so

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
there's always this give and take

78
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,359
between the project i want to complete

79
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,518
the problems that emerge and how i learn

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
from both of those things

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
so when i use the acronym pbl i'm kind

82
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,039
of talking about

83
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,159
both of these things at the same time

84
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,400
now

85
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,479
whether we're talking about students or

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
just grown-ups in the real world trying

87
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,679
to accomplish real things

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,598
pbl gives us the opportunity to practice

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,959
collaboration

90
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,719
and exec executive functioning okay

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,199
executive functioning is just planning

92
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,199
and execution how do you set priorities

93
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,799
how do you make plans what do you need

94
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,598
to do to get the job done

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
and of course uh to solve most great

96
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,840
problems

97
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,639
you need a team you need to be able to

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,360
collaborate with people

99
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,598
teachers are always paying attention to

100
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,480
formative assessment this is not like

101
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,518
taking the sats or a big exam at the end

102
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,598
of the year

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,439
formative assessment happens all the

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
time and the point is

105
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,560
never to call students out on what they

106
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,439
do or don't know

107
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,719
it's for teachers to find out what

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
students know

109
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,000
so that teachers can help their students

110
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,598
take the next

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
step the teacher's responsibility then

112
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,439
is to provide

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
scaffolding based on what i know about

114
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,840
these learners

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,000
how can i help them understand what

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,039
their next few steps might be

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,680
i'm going to provide scaffolding to help

118
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,158
people along their journey of course

119
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,200
this doesn't happen all at once

120
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,679
but if we work hard at it and if we

121
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,039
iterate between formative assessment and

122
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
scaffolding

123
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,039
what we're going to eventually do is

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,439
provide people with more

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
agency and that's really my number one

126
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,040
goal as a teacher

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,919
anytime i teach i judge the lesson to be

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
successful

129
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,519
if people go away from it having more

130
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
ability to make their own decisions

131
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,959
more ability to define what their next

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
steps are

133
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,638
ideas that they're really excited to

134
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,720
follow through

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,160
on that's what learning is all about

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,919
so wrapped up in this is this

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,439
distinction between intrinsic and

138
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,478
extrinsic motivation right grades are

139
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,560
extrinsic motivators kind of like the

140
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,199
token value of cardano if you think

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,918
about it

142
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,439
right extrinsic motivation these these

143
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,319
these carrots and sticks

144
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,519
out in the world versus intrinsic

145
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,000
motivation

146
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,639
which is the feeling that oh i can't

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,439
resist

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,560
doing the next thing i want to see this

149
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,439
project through

150
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,199
i want to solve this problem because it

151
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,680
matters to me

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
and finally one more distinction between

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
teaching and learning i touched on this

154
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,639
a little bit

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,439
but the focus for all teachers has to be

156
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
how much are people learning not how

157
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,839
smart do i sound

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
not how many of my ideas can i throw out

159
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,879
there to the world

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
but how much are people really

161
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,879
understanding

162
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,560
and this is an ongoing thing in teaching

163
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,959
if you walk into any school

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
you're going to see teachers on opposite

165
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,839
ends and everywhere in between of this

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
continuum

167
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,079
between thinking teaching is about them

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,600
standing up and delivering content

169
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,599
and students actually understanding

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
things i've had a lot of good arguments

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
about this over the years but i come

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,240
down pretty strongly on the end

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,879
that it's not about me it's about how

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,240
much

175
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,000
other people can understand you can let

176
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,759
me know if it's working for this starter

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,319
kit okay i encourage your participation

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
so to summarize teaching is only

179
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
effective

180
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,038
if it leads to learning and as teachers

181
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,719
our role

182
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,159
is to think about the people that we're

183
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
trying to connect with

184
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,600
and find the right projects find the

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
right problems

186
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,439
find the right metaphors and find the

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,319
right stories to tell

188
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,680
so we can help people take the next step

189
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
on their journey

190
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
understand the next thing that they

191
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:42,478
didn't understand before

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,039
so let's apply this to cardano

193
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,639
over the last few months i've really

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,639
started to recognize

195
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
that preparing for a conversation with

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,840
my friends or with my family

197
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,758
is similar to how i plan to teach a

198
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,679
lesson about high school algebra

199
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,439
okay and so let's think about how a few

200
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,439
of these things apply

201
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,279
to planning for conversations about

202
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,360
cardano

203
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,879
first of all planning and conversations

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
are iterative it's not like you go from

205
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,279
planning then you have a conversation

206
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,598
then it's done

207
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,038
right any conversation is going to raise

208
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,120
new questions for you

209
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,639
it's going to help you recognize things

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
that you wish you were better at

211
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
explaining

212
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,199
so you're gonna have a chance to

213
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,560
practice that okay

214
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,319
it's really important to choose content

215
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,879
selectively there are so many

216
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,080
opportunities there's so many articles

217
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,598
blog posts

218
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:39,120
podcasts videos out there where people

219
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:42,560
talk about blockchain and cardano

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,879
don't just fill up on this content

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
make sure you have a chance to digest

222
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,680
what you're consuming

223
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,478
make time to think and reflect on the

224
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
ideas

225
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,439
that you learn and while going back to

226
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,000
this idea of executive functioning right

227
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,319
don't just watch everything you don't

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,519
have to keep up on everything

229
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,680
choose carefully what's relevant to you

230
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,399
to the people you're trying to connect

231
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,038
with our community is growing

232
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,318
right trying to keep up on every podcast

233
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,399
is really hard

234
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
and i'm not going to name the e there's

235
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,318
there's there's no way to judge which

236
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,878
podcasts are better than the others

237
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
because

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,800
there's no objective measure of that it

239
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,439
just depends on

240
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
who you're trying to talk to and what

241
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,598
you're trying

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,959
to accomplish okay but do be selective

243
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,679
whatever you select

244
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,639
do be selective and then make sure you

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,199
have time

246
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,879
to think through what you're what you're

247
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,879
ingesting what you're consuming from a

248
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,038
media perspective

249
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,360
now conversations help if you've never

250
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,159
gone to a cardano blockchain meetup

251
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
i really recommend going on meetup.com

252
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,319
i'll leave a link to it

253
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,959
and finding a cardano blockchain meetup

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
that's helpful to you join discord and

255
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,518
telegram channels

256
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,360
try ideas on reddit to see how they go

257
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,278
this is all part and parcel with

258
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
practicing and you're going to discover

259
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,240
the ways

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
that make the most sense to you about

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,278
how you're going to

262
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
communicate because at the end of the

263
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,320
day the little things we do

264
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
all add up i am a firm believer that

265
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,720
small actions

266
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,799
over time lead to greater results than

267
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,639
just grand speculation

268
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,359
is it fun to talk about what cardano's

269
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,919
going to do over the next few decades

270
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,159
absolutely i can daydream about that all

271
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,360
day and i can have really high spirited

272
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,600
conversations

273
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,519
inside the cardano community about that

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,639
but if we really want to accomplish

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,320
those things

276
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,759
it's not about just having those big

277
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,800
picture conversations

278
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:46,480
it's about doing what we can do today

279
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,278
to move the ball incrementally further

280
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
towards that the other metaphor right

281
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,240
it's a marathon

282
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,600
not a sprint we're not gonna just flip

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,519
the lights on one day

284
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
gogan's gonna come out right we're

285
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
learning about that

286
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,000
right now right that doesn't that's not

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
the end of the story that's just the

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,440
beginning and we all have work to do

289
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,959
on a daily basis one more metaphor

290
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
i love the metaphor of drops in the

291
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,159
bucket okay so i'm just listing

292
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,039
different ways you can think about it

293
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,039
here

294
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,360
again you might have a different way

295
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,679
that you like to think about it

296
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,240
that's the most important thing i'm just

297
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,799
throwing a few ideas out there

298
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,480
so here's your task for part one of this

299
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,120
starter kit

300
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,399
i want you to balance content with

301
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,360
reflection

302
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,039
watch or listen to any podcast you want

303
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
i'll make some suggestions

304
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,039
um later in this starter kit but don't

305
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,839
follow me just

306
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
whatever is relevant to you to your

307
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,839
goals

308
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,879
listen to a podcast about that and then

309
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
walk away put away the earbuds put away

310
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,799
your computer

311
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,199
whether it's uh you know cooking dinner

312
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,439
or

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
doing some chores going for a walk or

314
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
staring out the window

315
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:03,599
whatever step away and spend some time

316
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:06,719
contemplating metaphors or stories

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,759
that will help you explain that idea

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,639
then practice and iterate

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,159
go have conversations go see how those

320
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,838
metaphors land

321
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:20,319
and see if they work out okay finally

322
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
make sure to keep your goals in mind one

323
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
of mine is increased

324
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
agency i want more people to be able to

325
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,680
do more things

326
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
to be able to make their visions come to

327
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,278
reality

328
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
for another way to think about goals and

329
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,000
why this matters

330
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,919
let's take a look at what josh was

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,919
saying a couple weeks ago on the afrofin

332
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,599
lab podcast check it out like you're

333
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,039
understanding right now because i

334
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
believe you're going to go back and do

335
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,919
some more research

336
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
and trust me you start talking to your

337
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,919
friend about this thing so that's how it

338
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,559
starts right each one reach one right

339
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,199
so you need to go back and people need

340
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,559
to start

341
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,879
hearing and learning about this in uh

342
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,838
you know the topic for i mean part of

343
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,759
our motto is

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,519
make this crypto nonsense make sense

345
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,360
people need to start making this

346
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
crypto nonsense make sense to their

347
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
friends and that is the beginning of the

348
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
revolution and

349
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,480
adoption of blockchain technology and

350
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
also that is the first step that needs

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
to happen

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,278
before we can gradually uh

353
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,959
subliminally collect power from these

354
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,439
power grabbers

355
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,638
yes josh you see this is why you're a

356
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,839
great teacher

357
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,519
you see you have this big grand vision

358
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,880
for the problems we're gonna solve

359
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,480
what's the problem

360
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,759
centralization power how centralized

361
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
power can corrupt

362
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,319
people okay we all want to undo that we

363
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,519
all want to push back against

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
that but how well you named it we got to

365
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,278
take our first

366
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,079
step we have to have conversations with

367
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,480
our friends

368
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,799
we have to get the word out there and

369
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,759
it's slow work but we can help people

370
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,679
understand this one of the things that

371
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,039
helps people gain understanding like

372
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,559
i've already mentioned

373
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,759
is metaphors and stories now using

374
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,319
metaphors takes

375
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,078
practice and that's why again

376
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,040
conversations and planning are

377
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:14,159
iterative let's take a listen to sydney

378
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,399
from that same episode of the podcast

379
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,078
using a metaphor that he leans on quite

380
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,399
often

381
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,958
you know what joshua said is um

382
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
you you i don't know i can't say what

383
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,239
people on this

384
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,480
call know and don't know i'm not sure

385
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,159
who's an auto mechanic here and knows

386
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
how an engine works

387
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,399
um but clearly i think that everyone

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
on the call has driven a car before um

389
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,360
so you don't need to know how the engine

390
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,078
works

391
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,199
in order to get in and turn the key and

392
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,679
use the

393
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,159
brake and the gas pedals can you tell

394
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,039
that sydney has had a chance to practice

395
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,159
using this metaphor of engines in

396
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,240
automobiles

397
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,278
and how it applies to the inner workings

398
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
of blockchain

399
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,958
okay in that particular conversation he

400
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,278
was applying it

401
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,239
to questions that we had about mass

402
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,559
adoption

403
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
right but that metaphor could also work

404
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,239
in a one-on-one conversation with a

405
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,719
newcomer to cardano

406
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,959
and when you practice using metaphors

407
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,519
when you see how they fall

408
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,879
then you have more and more experience

409
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,078
and you can apply them

410
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,320
with more nuance to any conversation

411
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,000
that you hit on all right so now i'm

412
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
going to show me being kind of awkward

413
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,039
with a metaphor this was something that

414
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,279
i thought of for the first time

415
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,198
and i probably wouldn't say it the same

416
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,958
way check it out

417
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,359
i just got this image as you were

418
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,958
speaking of like a tide

419
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,800
just sort of like you know and like

420
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,799
people who are like in power like

421
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,159
standing in front of the tide like oh no

422
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,559
this isn't going to happen but they're

423
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,078
like

424
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,479
literally just like a wave just

425
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,679
because it's it's coming i feel like

426
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
we're in a time

427
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,278
and a place globally right now where

428
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
it's like

429
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:01,039
people are i think people

430
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,198
i think there's a lot of like a lot of

431
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,679
feeling of

432
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,198
this this sense of you know you're

433
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,799
you're you're a government

434
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,719
you're meant to be here for us and if

435
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,719
you're not here for us then

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
you know we need to be here for

437
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,680
ourselves and i

438
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,040
you know that's uh that's one of the

439
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,479
things that hooks me when it comes to

440
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,799
blockchain and like this whole idea of

441
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
decentralizing it and making it about

442
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,159
what are the needs that we have what the

443
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,720
problems that we have

444
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,719
like putting tools in people's hands

445
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,519
that's it add that to the to the

446
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,799
metaphor right we're trying to hand out

447
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
as many dingy boats and scuba gear and

448
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,719
all the things so that

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,679
so that all of us can be safe in that

450
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
wave right

451
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,078
it's happening but we need we need

452
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,039
people to understand that it's coming

453
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,359
yikes well i mean aziza's metaphor was

454
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,159
great this tidal wave coming over

455
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
all of us changing the world right and

456
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,078
you could extend that one if you want to

457
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
and i got so excited about it that i

458
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,198
jumped in with dingy boats and scuba

459
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,399
gear i

460
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,479
you know i don't know if i would say it

461
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,480
the same way as that again

462
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,159
right but that's the whole point when we

463
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,039
have conversations

464
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,919
we have a chance to practice the way we

465
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,719
say things

466
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,319
to practice the way things resonate and

467
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
you know i probably certainly wouldn't

468
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,079
say it the same way as

469
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
that again but i do need to go for a

470
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,278
walk

471
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,559
and think about well what are the

472
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,679
metaphors

473
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:31,039
how how are we helping people

474
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,479
navigate this wave of of new things

475
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,838
that's happening

476
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
now the only way to do that is through

477
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,360
conversations

478
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
and we're going to cover that in the

479
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
next part of this starter kit

480
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
one of the things i've learned in my

481
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,359
teaching career

482
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,879
is that the more broadly i prepare for a

483
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,480
lesson

484
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:02,000
the more able i am during that lesson to

485
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,600
really engage with people if i'm not

486
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,160
prepared i might just have a quick

487
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,759
script

488
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,640
to read and want to get through the

489
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,439
points that i want to say

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
but if i'm really prepared if i've done

491
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,038
my research

492
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,079
and practiced thinking about things

493
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,599
then i'm able to be fully present

494
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,198
with the people that i'm trying to help

495
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,038
learn something

496
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,919
okay a great teacher of mine

497
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,879
helped me understand that gentleness

498
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,120
comes from

499
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
strength and i've always really

500
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:39,038
appreciated that lesson

501
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:42,079
the stronger and more prepared i am

502
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,079
the gentler i'm able to be and speaking

503
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,798
of metaphors this metaphor applies to

504
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,159
both

505
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:51,918
physical strength being gentle with

506
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,000
heavy delicate objects right

507
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,400
and it also applies to human

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,839
relationships

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,200
so when we come to conversations

510
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,519
about cardano i think it helps to think

511
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,160
of them as

512
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,960
problem-based conversations

513
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,679
jaime gossip a famous educator he's

514
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,519
worked at

515
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,960
google and i'll link to a video

516
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,839
that i got this quote from he asks

517
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,600
these three questions what problem do

518
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:26,480
you want to solve

519
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,879
how do you want to solve that problem

520
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
and

521
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,039
what do you need to learn to solve that

522
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,559
problem and he shows

523
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,798
how personal these questions are

524
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,000
not only the question about the problem

525
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,200
we want to solve

526
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,880
but what can i do how do i want to

527
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,480
contribute

528
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,080
that's a very subjective question and

529
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
everybody's going to have a different

530
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,558
answer to it that's kind of the beauty

531
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,840
of decentralization

532
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,319
we all have a chance to

533
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:01,279
and then once you get people to talk

534
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:04,399
about the problems they want to solve

535
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:06,639
now we can start asking them okay how

536
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,600
can i help you how can i help you learn

537
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,120
what you need to know in order to do

538
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,959
that

539
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,319
now we've been collecting videos from

540
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
the community

541
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,159
about how to talk about cardano and i

542
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
want to share

543
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,558
one of my favorite clips from steve

544
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,558
aldrich

545
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,960
i'm going to let you see steve drop the

546
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,798
mic and then how he continues on because

547
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,079
i think it's a great way

548
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,639
uh to to kind of frame

549
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,918
why we think about problem and project

550
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
based learning

551
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,120
and what i mean by problem-based

552
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,599
conversations

553
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,399
so here's steve what problem does

554
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,199
cardano solve

555
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,080
what problem do you have in the latest

556
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,798
catalyst funding round we had 126

557
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,399
proposals which are all solving for

558
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,279
different problems

559
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,240
look blockchain or more specifically

560
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,879
cardano

561
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,558
is not a solution looking for a problem

562
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
nor is it a silver bullet

563
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,639
for all the problems of the world the

564
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,720
fact remains that

565
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,720
financial and governance systems across

566
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,360
the globe are in one way or another

567
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,038
broken

568
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,959
or at least in need of a good cleaning

569
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,158
up if we can

570
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,480
solve for the financial or identity

571
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,840
or governance issues in places where

572
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,279
these are a problem

573
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,918
then we have a successful project

574
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,119
if that then grows outward to solve

575
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,038
other problems

576
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,319
which maybe we can't even comprehend

577
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,440
today

578
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,558
well that's just groovy steve thank you

579
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,880
for that

580
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,240
and for everybody out there looking to

581
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,440
start conversations

582
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,240
that's really all you have to say what

583
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,480
problem do you have

584
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,759
now what i really like about what steve

585
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,720
shares there is how he continues on

586
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,480
to talk about how solving one set of

587
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,240
problems

588
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,960
opens up the door to solve more problems

589
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,000
this idea of incremental growth and

590
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,480
iteration

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,759
once we build habits of solving problems

592
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,720
together

593
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,519
once we practice talking about them then

594
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
we can address

595
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,879
even bigger problems some of which like

596
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
steve says

597
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,600
we haven't even imagined yet

598
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,559
so think back to some of that teaching

599
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,519
terminology i shared with you earlier

600
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,038
how can you treat conversations as

601
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,119
formative assessments

602
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,158
and based on what you learned from

603
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,158
people

604
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,440
how can you scaffold for your friends

605
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,760
and your family

606
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,759
how to help them learn the next thing

607
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,440
how well are you bringing people into

608
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,679
these conversations

609
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,038
is your focus really on helping people

610
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,798
learn

611
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,640
or do you just want to tell people how

612
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,720
great cardano is

613
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,679
all right all of us that's what our

614
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
community is for

615
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
come on anytime we could talk about how

616
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,639
much we love this project and

617
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,319
what we think it's going to do but when

618
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
it comes to talking about

619
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,038
cardano with your friends and family

620
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,038
please focus on learning

621
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,240
please focus on what people understand

622
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,440
so far

623
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,599
and how you're going to help them

624
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,240
understand what's next

625
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,519
we're not in charge because we're not

626
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,440
here just to

627
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,679
talk about what we want to talk about we

628
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,400
got to meet people where they're at

629
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,480
again remember this is iterative work

630
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,720
and it's not about you digesting all

631
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,839
this information that's out there

632
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:32,400
it's about how well you're prepared

633
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:36,000
to help people understand things so

634
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,200
this task is easy go have a conversation

635
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,319
and while you're having that

636
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,159
conversation think about what problems

637
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,240
people are naming

638
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,320
think about what metaphors might help

639
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
and maybe try using some of the ones

640
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,158
you've brainstormed

641
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,919
and as you reflect on the conversation

642
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
you'll think of new ways that you might

643
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,000
need to develop for explaining things

644
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:00,960
what questions came up and then

645
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
if you want to come reflect uh with with

646
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,519
the rest of us in discord

647
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
you'll see a link in in the materials

648
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,240
accompanying

649
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,319
this video come pop into discord

650
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
share questions that stump to you or you

651
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,079
found particularly interesting

652
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,280
share metaphors that you're proud of

653
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,960
using uh

654
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,480
and if you you know if you put your foot

655
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,200
in your mouth and you want to talk about

656
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,200
that too

657
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,840
we'd love to hear that i do it all the

658
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,720
time i'm probably doing it in this video

659
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,119
um but this is our practice right this

660
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,400
is how we learn and grow together

661
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,239
now optionally for this part i was

662
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
really moved um

663
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,079
by frederick greygards i hope i'm saying

664
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
his name right um the new

665
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,359
cardano foundation ceo i listened to a

666
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,798
30-minute interview of him on the crypto

667
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,278
valley podcast

668
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,400
and i was really impressed i really

669
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,679
admired

670
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,278
the way he was framing questions about

671
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
cardano adoption

672
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,359
from a problem-based standpoint and i

673
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,960
would really recommend

674
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,399
i was talking before about choosing

675
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
quality content

676
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,400
i would definitely recommend this as

677
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,919
really high quality content

678
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,440
really interesting uh to a hear that

679
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
cardano foundation is in

680
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,038
is in good hands uh as far as what i'm

681
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,959
hearing there

682
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:22,079
um but that he's got such a great grasp

683
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
on approaching these conversations from

684
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,558
a problem-based

685
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,400
perspective all right so next we're

686
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,599
gonna spend a few minutes going out into

687
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
the real world

688
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,839
and getting some ada into people's hands

689
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,240

00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,639
on a 3d printer so lots of exciting

732
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,320
stuff happening around here

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
adam thanks for coming out tonight no

everybody soon

736
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,799
all right so in terms of real world use

737
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,799
just sending a little bit of ada back

738
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,000
and forth between wallets

739
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,798
is about the extent of what most people

740
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,319
can do

741
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,720
right now okay that's all right

742
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,918
there's a lot more functionality coming

743
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,079
out

744
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,759
the middle of next year gogin is going

745
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,839
to be fully released

746
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,119
we're going to be able to use it in the

747
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,240
coming months

748
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,639
as parts of it go online

749
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,558
we want to have chances to play with it

750
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,960
to see what we can do with it

751
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,319
and that's why cardano starter kits

752
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,558
exist

753
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,480
listen i really don't want to be the

754
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,038
face and the voice of cardano starter

755
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,919
kits

756
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,119
i love doing this i love sharing my own

757
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,759
perspective

758
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,558
but i'm really hoping if i if i do this

759
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,839
right

760
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,879
other people are going to want to

761
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:22,398
contribute too and that means you

762
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,520
if if you find this question of how

763
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,599
local use will contribute to the

764
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,319
adoption of cardano

765
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,678
please be in touch i know this isn't the

766
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,398
whole story

767
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,240
there's really important work going on

768
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,199
the enterprise level

769
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,919
there's really incredible work being

770
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,558
done around

771
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
oracle pools and decentralized

772
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,960
identities

773
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,640
and all of that is so important

774
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,319
it's ground breaking

775
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,399
alongside that let's also address these

776
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,038
questions of local adoption

777
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,558
all right if you want to get involved

778
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,798
there's a discord link

779
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,480
to accompany this starter kit where you

780
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:07,038
can come talk about

781
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,200
the ideas in this starter kit your own

782
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,200
experiences with implementation

783
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,720
but you can also start to participate in

784
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,519
some of the bigger conversations we're

785
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,519
having

786
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,038
we would love to have you there all

787
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,038
right

788
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,640
there's one more part of this starter

789
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,398
kit part four

790
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,320
i'm going to release it in a separate

791
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,000
video you'll see the links in the

792
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,158
documentation here

793
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,839
where we dive into marlow a little bit

794
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,760
and there's another call to action there

795
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,519
with a project you can do

796
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:39,759
um it's really exciting the vision

797
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,839
of the iohk team around marlow

798
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,960
i was just watching the october

799
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,558
development update

800
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,798
earlier today and just to see

801
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,678
that team talking about how this is a

802
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,440
tool

803
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,960
they want to put in everybody's hands

804
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,720
that's what we're here for that's what

805
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
gets me up in the morning and i

806
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,960
really i'm so thrilled to try to

807
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,038
contribute to that work

808
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,038
all right invite you to do the same

809
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,199
the action step for part three go out in

810
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,079
your community

811
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,880
help somebody get hands-on with cardano

812
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,038
okay

813
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,080
it's challenging uh to buy ada right now

814
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,960
okay so like i did i i

815
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,720
had adam design a logo for me and i

816
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,200
asked him hey can i pay you an ada

817
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,960
and he was fine with that so i did now

818
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,600
he's got some ada in his wallet

819
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,759
he now he can feel what it's like and

820
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,759
maybe eventually he'll purchase his own

821
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,000
maybe he'll use the ada i gave him to

822
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,240
stake it and he'll find out what that's

823
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
what that's like right maybe he'll pay

824
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,399
somebody else

825
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,200
this is how we drive adoption right we

826
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:46,959
just start

827
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
getting the the idea out there and

828
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,919
people start to say

829
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,038
ah okay i see right there's gonna be a

830
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,038
lot more ways

831
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,480
to get hands-on with cardano in the

832
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,519
years to come

833
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,960
for now let's jump in

834
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,879
so to close out we're going to go back

835
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,038
to this question about having

836
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,840
problem-based conversations

837
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,158
i'm going to let sydney take us home in

838
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,839
this story he tells

839
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,000
about a conversation he was having with

840
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,079
his brother so thank you so much for

841
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,759
spending this time with me today

842
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,678
make sure to check out part four if

843
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,640
you're interested in learning more about

844
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
marlow

845
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,360
and i'll see you soon take care i mean i

846
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:27,519
don't know how these things will happen

847
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,599
i do believe that blockchain will have a

848
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,240
hand in solving these problems

849
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,319
um and i was having a conversation just

850
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,399
before our call today

851
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:40,720
with my brother who is a um

852
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,398
a police officer for the the memphis

853
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,000
police police department

854
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:48,158
and his wife who uh manages um

855
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
uh nurses for one of the hospitals here

856
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,320
in memphis and we had this deep

857
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,919
conversation

858
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,319
about um how how do we help people

859
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,360
because in the memphis area um there's a

860
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,678
there's a lot of

861
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,719
um there's a lot of things that that

862
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,000
occur

863
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,679
that um uh you know that that

864
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,640
that are hard to deal with a lot of you

865
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,240
know lack of resources a lot of um

866
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,000
violence a lot a lot of those types of

867
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,200
things and i was asking so how do

868
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,519
how do we fix those problems and i was

869
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,558
trying to pull that out of them

870
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,200
because i know um

871
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,038
without a doubt that blockchain will

872
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,919
facilitate

873
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,440
those solutions so whatever they were

874
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,120
what they were telling me about the

875
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,919
problem

876
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,879
i know that we can we can apply their

877
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,159
solutions

878
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,799
on a blockchain network that will

879
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,278
meet each person individually where they

880
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,158
are

881
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,558
and help to resolve these huge problems

882
00:31:44,159 --> 00:32:01,039
that we've been talking about fixing for

883
00:31:46,558 --> 00:32:01,038
for centuries now
