## Education Terms

* Project Based Learning: We learn by doing things
* Problem Based Learning: We learn by figuring things out
* PBL: Opportunities to practice collaboration and executive functioning
* Formative Assessment: Finding out what people know/understand
* Scaffolding: Build upon what people know, reveal next steps
* Agency: People making their own decisions, defining actions
* Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation: Why should someone do something?
* Teaching vs Learning: Do I focus on what I know, or what others understand?

## Teaching is effective only if it leads to learning

* Find the right projects
* Find the right problems
* Find the right metaphors
* Find the right stories

## Part 1: Lesson Planning in PBL Context
### How do you prepare for conversations about Cardano?

* Planning and conversations are iterative
* Choose quality content
* Balance content consumption with making time to think about how  you’ll apply what you just learned from that content
* Join conversations: Meetups, Discord, Reddit, Cardano Forum
* Small actions > Grand speculation
* Marathon > Sprint
* Drops in the bucket: If you practice and participate  a little every day, you’ll come up with good ideas

## Part 1 Task: Balance Content with Reflection
### How do you prepare for conversations about Cardano?

* Watch or listen to any podcast you want
* Step away and think of a metaphor or story that will help you explain that idea
* Practice + Iterate
* Name your goals. (One of mine is increased agency)

### "What problem do you want to solve? How do you want to solve that problem? What do you need to learn to solve that problem?"
-- Jaime Casap

## Part 2: Problem-Based Conversations

* Formative assessment & Scaffolding
* Is your focus on teaching or learning?
* You’re not in charge
### Remember:
* This is iterative work
* It’s not about how much information you can  cram into your head, it’s about how much you’re  able to help other people understand.

## Part 2 Task: Go have a Conversation

### Assess
* What problems do you hear?
* What metaphors have you tried?
* What questions were raised in your conversation?
### Reflect
* Share in Discord
### Prepare (Optional)
* Listen to Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard on the Crypto Valley Podcast (linked in accompanying document)

## Part 3: Project-Based Outcomes

* What can we do now?
* What will we do soon?
* This is why we’re creating CSKs
* Ways to get involved

## Part 3 Tasks: Set up Wallets + Problem Sensing

* Go help someone get hands-on with Cardano!
* Join the conversation on Discord

## Part 4: How can the Marlowe Playground help us talk about Cardano?

* What can non-developers do with the Marlowe Playground?
* In a conversation, how would you describe each of the five contracts?
* Deeper dive: what is the difference between If and Assert contracts?
* Further reading (see docs)
* What new questions does this raise?
